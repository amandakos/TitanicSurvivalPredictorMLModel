# TitanicSurvivalPredictorMLModel
Using Decision Tree and Random Forest Models and the Titanic dataset in the Seaborn package of Python, a machine learning model is created to attempt to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. 
This was my third iteration of variables and hypertuning parameters to come up with the most accurate model with just shy of 80% accuracy.
